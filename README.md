# Bakery-Website
Bellaria Bakery is a website I created to share my love for baking. Built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a bit of JavaScript, it showcases a variety of baked goods like cakes, pastries, and bread. The site is fully responsive, easy to use, and allows visitors to explore the menu and place orders. This project is special to me because it combines my passion for baking with my web development skills.
